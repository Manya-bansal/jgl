<div id="instruct-1">
  <p> Before we begin, please expand this window to full screen and refresh the page! </p>
  <p> You will be shown two flashing blobs of light on the screen. </p>
  <img src="#" style="width:25%" text-align="center">
  <p>Your job is to identify which of the stimuli is further to the left. </p>
  <p>If you think the first stimuli was further to the left, press the button 1 on your keyboard. However, if you think the second stimuli was further to the left, press 2 on your keyboard</p>
</div>

<div id="instruct-2">
  <p>After you respnd, a rectangle will be displayed on the screen and will be filled to a random startng point. You will use this to tell how confident you are in your decision. If you are sure that you are right, then scroll upwards to fill the rectangle and click the mouse. If you are sure that you are wrong, scroll downwards to empty the rectangle and click the mouse. If you are somewhat sure, then scroll up or down to fill the rectangle to the approximate level of your confidence and click the button. Try to make your confidence judgement across trials span the range from empty to fill. Click the mouse once to move on to the next stimulus. </p>

<div id="instruct-3">
	<p>Here are some things you will want to keep in mind:</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px"> (1) At all times during the task you should fixate (i.e. look at the cross). Donâ€™t look at the stimulus directly. </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px">(2) When the task begins, the task 'loads' to set up the screen before displaying the first frame, this might take a couple of seconds. 
</p>

<div id="instruct-4">
	<p>Please pay attention and do your best. We'll start with 5 quick trials to practice, and after that, we will get into the real trials, where you must complete 4 blocks of 40 trials each. </p>
</div>

<div id="instruct-block1">
   <p>Are you getting the hang of it? Now we'll start with the real experiment! Each section is 40 trials long, and you will be going through 4 sections in total.</p>
   <p>Click next to begin your first block of 40 trials. </p>
